Self referential structure 

A structure that contains a pointer to its own type. A structure that can refer too another variable of its own .. this concept is the foundation of dynamic data structures such as :

Linked list , Stack , Queues ,Tree , Graphs

Syntax 
 struct item {
int a;
struct item * ptr;
};

int main ( ){
struct item i1;
struct item i2;
i1.ptr = &i2;
};

PRIMITIVE DATA STRUCTURES

Primitive Data structures are the basic fundamental data types provided by the C languages that:

--> Store single values
--> Occupy fixed memory 
--> Are directly supported by the compiler 

They are the building blocks for all other ( non - primitive ) data structures .

e.g : int , char , float , double , void , ( special purpose )

NON PRIMITIVE DATA STRUCTURES 

Non-primitive data structures store multiple values and represent Complex data relationships...


LINKED LIST 

Advantages  of linked list 

--> Dynamic size
--> Efficient insertion and Deletion  - No shift required 
--> No memory wastage 
--> Does not required contingous memory 
--> Better for frequent updates ..
