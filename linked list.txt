Self referential structure 

A structure that contains a pointer to its own type. A structure that can refer too another variable of its own .. this concept is the foundation of dynamic data structures such as :

Linked list , Stack , Queues ,Tree , Graphs

Syntax 
 struct item {
int a;
struct item * ptr;
};

int main ( ){
struct item i1;
struct item i2;
i1.ptr = &i2;
};

PRIMITIVE DATA STRUCTURES

Primitive Data structures are the basic fundamental data types provided by the C languages that:

--> Store single values
--> Occupy fixed memory 
--> Are directly supported by the compiler 

They are the building blocks for all other ( non - primitive ) data structures .

e.g : int , char , float , double , void , ( special purpose )

NON PRIMITIVE DATA STRUCTURES 

Non-primitive data structures store multiple values and represent Complex data relationships...


LINKED LIST 

Advantages  of linked list 

--> Dynamic size
--> Efficient insertion and Deletion  - No shift required 
--> No memory wastage 
--> Does not required contingous memory 
--> Better for frequent updates ..


Basic terminology 
Node : Each element in a linked list is called a node 
A node contains :
1. Data 
2 . Link ( pointer to next node )

Structure of a node :

struct node{
int data;
struct node *next;
};

int main ()
{
struct node var1 ;
var1.data = 10;
var1.next = Null;
}

Types of linked list 

1. Singly linked list 
2. Doubly Linked list 
3. Circular linked list 

Singly linked list 
--> Each node points to the next node
--> Last node points to NULL
--> Navigation is forward only 

Double linked list 
--> Navigation is forward aand backward both
--> Each node has two links ( prev and next )

Circular Linked list
Last element is linked to the first element..


CREATING A SINGLY LINKED LIST

Step 1 - Define Node structure.
Step 2 - Create Head pointer 
Step 3 - Create a new node dynamically 
Step 4 - Assign data to the node
Step 5 - Connect Node to the list
